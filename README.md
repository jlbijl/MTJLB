Scripts used for my master thesis on explainable AI

These scripts were used for completing my master thesis about visual quality control and explainable AI.
Due to confidentiality, the initial data set is not uploaded. These scripts are not intended to be replicated,
but have the purpose to show what has been done to get the reported output in the thesis. Furthermore, these scripts are in no 
way a product of my own thinking, they are based on established methods and existing code. The source can be found below.

The Grad-cam script is based on this repository by Yassine Yousfi (https://github.com/YassineYousfi): 
  https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/vision/grad_cam.py
  
The LIME script is based on theses scripts by Cristian Arteaga (https://gist.github.com/arteagac):
