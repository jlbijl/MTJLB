Scripts used for my master thesis on explainable AI

These scripts were used for completing my master thesis about visual quality control and explainable AI.
Due to confidentiality, the initial data set is not uploaded. Furthermore, these scripts are not intended to be replicated,
but has the purpose to show what has been done to get the output reported in the thesis. The scripts should function as a way to verify what 
has been done.
